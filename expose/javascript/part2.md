1. Line 12 will print 3 because it prints i, which is a var that incremented from 0 to 3 in the for loop, and is accessible outside of the for loop block.
   
2. Line 13 will print 150 because it prints var discountedPrice, which was assigned 150 in the last loop of the for loop, and is accessible outside of the for loop block.
   
3. Line 14 will print 150 because it prints var finalPrice, which was assigned 150 in the last loop of the for loop, and is accessible outside of the for loop block.
   
4. The function returns the array of values [50, 100, 150]. The function recieves the array [100, 200, 300] and 0.5, and the for loop applies math to each element of the array, and pushes the result into another array that is ultimately returned after the loop.
   
5. Error, i wouldn't be defined because i is being accessed outside of the for loop it is defined in.
   
6. Error, discountedPrice wouldn't be defined because discountedPrice is being accessed outside of the for loop it is defined in.
   
7. Line 14 will print 150 because it prints finalPrice, which was set to 150 in the last loop of the for loop, and is accessible within the function block.

8. The function returns an array of values: 50, 100, 150. The function recieves the array [100, 200, 300] and 0.5, and the for loop applies math to each element of the array, and pushes the result into another array that is ultimately returned after the loop.
   
9. Error, i wouldn't be defined because i is being accessed outside of the for loop it is defined in.
    
10. Line 12 will print 3 because it accesses the constant length, which was set to 3, and is accessible within the scope of the function.
    
11. The function returns an array of values: 50, 100, 150. The function recieves the array [100, 200, 300] and 0.5, and the for loop applies math to each element of the array, and pushes the result into another array that is ultimately returned after the loop.
